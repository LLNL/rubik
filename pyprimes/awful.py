what **not** to do.

None of these methods have acceptable performance in practice; they are
barely tolerable even for the first 100 primes.

      than the candidate, instead of stopping early;

    The function is named for David Turner, who developed this implementation
    in a paper in 1975. Due to its simplicity, it has become very popular,
    particularly in Haskell circles where it is usually implemented as some
    variation of::

        primes = sieve [2..]
        sieve (p : xs) = p : sieve [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p > 0]

    This algorithm is sometimes wrongly described as the Sieve of
    Eratosthenes, but it is not, it is a version of Euler's Sieve.

    Although simple, it is extremely slow and inefficient, with
    asymptotic behaviour of O(N**2/(log N)**2) which is worse than
    trial division, and only marginally better than ``primes0``.

    In her paper http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf
    O'Neill calls this the "Sleight on Eratosthenes".
