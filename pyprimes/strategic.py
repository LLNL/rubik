"""The module implements various prime generating and testing functions using
the Strategy design pattern, allowing the caller to easily experiment with
different algorithms and implementations.

The functions in this module will take at least one mandatory argument,
usually named either ``strategy`` or ``prover``.

    strategy:

        The ``strategy`` argument is used to delegate to a prime generator.
        It must be a function which takes no arguments and returns an
        iterator that yields primes. (A generator function is a convenient
        way to manage this.)

        This module makes no check that the strategy function actually
        yields prime numbers. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure
        that is the case.

    prover:

        The ``prover`` argument is used to delegate to a primality testing
        function. It must be a function which takes a single argument, an
        integer, and returns one of the following flags:

            0 or False      Number is definitely nonprime.
            1 or True       Number is definitely prime.
            2               Number is a probable prime or pseudoprime.

        Any other result will raise TypeError or ValueError.

        This module makes no check to confirm that the prover function
        actually tests for primality. It is the caller's responsibility to
        ensure that is the case.
