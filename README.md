To learn more about Rubik, you might be interested in the [Source Code for Rubik on GitHub](https://github.com/llnl/rubik),
along with the [documentation](https://computation.llnl.gov/project/performance-analysis-through-visualization/software/rubik/docs/index.html),
and or the [project webpage](https://computation.llnl.gov/project/performance-analysis-through-visualization/software.php#PAVESoftware-Rubik).

### Running Rubik Scripts

To use rubik, either add the `<distribution>/rubik` directory to your
`PYTHONPATH`, or just be sure to run scripts in the root directory.  A proper
setup.py and installation process is forthcoming.

### Pre-requisites

To generate map files with Rubik, you will need an installation of numpy.  To
visualize Rubik partitions, you will need PySide (python Qt bindings) and
OpenGL for Python.  To build the documentation you will need sphinx.

You can install all this relatively easily on a mac through MacPorts:

    port install py27-numpy py27-pyside py27-sphinx py27-opengl

For more on installation, see [the installation docs](https://computation.llnl.gov/project/performance-analysis-through-visualization/software/rubik/docs/intro.html#install).
